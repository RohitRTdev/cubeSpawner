# cubeSpawner
A silly 3d graphics playground that spawns 3d cubes on the console and let's you control it 

## Sample
<img src="https://github.com/RohitRTdev/cubeSpawner/blob/origin/sample.png">

This is a very silly project that I have made simply for fun, and didn't pay much attention to proper code structure and such.
Simply clone and build the application from Visual studio and you should see a black screen with a red wireframe rendered cube in it.

## Controls
Arrow keys -> To translate the cube in 3d space<br>
'z' and 'x' -> To move the cube forwards and backwards<br>
'a' and 'd' -> To rotate cube about y-axis<br>
'w' and 's' -> To rotate cube about x-axis<br>
'q' and 'e' -> To rotate cube about z-axis<br>
<br>
'f' and 'g' -> To zoom in and out of the scene<br>
'm' -> To spawn a new cube at the center of the world<br>
't' -> To toggle between different cubes(Once a cube is selected, you can then move or rotate it)
